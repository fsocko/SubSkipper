													I suppose the most frequently used/needed trig-formula

																				Hello Pisces,<br> <br> Thank you for
																						helping. There is an old saying : "when the
																						student is ready, the master appears " in french,
																						if you can understand, " Quand l'eleve est pret,
																						le Maitre apparait " Ok, obviously the time is not
																						there yet for me.... You showed up but it doesn'
																						seem I'm ready...But let's leave it there with
																						phylosophy and mysticism.<br> I have a Casio
																							fx-83ES. The problem is not with using the
																							Calculator, and after all I've got the manuals,
																							so this is another topic ( How to use your calc
																							machine ) this is not the real issue.<br>
																								The real issue for me is to get all "navigation"
																								( only ) trig formulas applied for Sh3. With
																								down to earth concrete examples.<br> What I
																									probably miss, if I have a formula under my
																									eyes, is a down to earth example for such
																									things as SPEED, DISTANCE, AOB calculation.
																									Basically I can't choose what formula applies
																									to what situation. <br> For example you
																										write : <br> side A/sin(angle opposite
																											side A)=side B/sin(angle opposite side
																											B)=side C/sin(angle opposite side C). I mean,
																											what gives ? To what particular situation
																											does it apply? <br> And what does it
																												apply to ? Are we searching for an angle or
																												for the length of one of the sides ??<br>
																													So from what I understand :<br> If you
																														look for the length of the adjacent side
																														of a triangle, knowing the value of the
																														angle which has this side as adjacent, and
																														knowing the length af the opposite side of
																														that angle, you can know the length of the
																														other side, with :<br> Tan (A) =
																															Length of opp. side<br>
																																--------------------<br> Length of
																																	adj. side<br> If you look for the
																																		value of an angle, having the length
																																		of the opposite side of that angle,
																																		and the adjacent angle, <br> Sin
																																			(A) = Length of opp. side applies<br>
																																				-------------------<br> Length
																																					of hypotenuse<br> Now, Cos (A)
																																						= Length of adj. side What do you
																																						get ? the length of one of <br>
																																							------------------- the other
																																							sides or the value of an<br>
																																								Length of hypotenuse angle, and
																																								if yes, which one ?<br> <br>
																																										You can see now that I'm very
																																										thick on those trig things,
																																										but I suppose, from what I've
																																										seen, that I'm not the only
																																										one... And I'm not the only
																																										one that would like to get
																																										very basic applied trig
																																										solutions for SAH3, whithout
																																										daring ask or look too stupid.
																																										So I making the sacrifice.Or
																																										may be I sould take some
																																										private trig 50 Euro/hour
																																										courses...<br> <br>
																																												Thanks for any help, and to
																																												you Pisces, please be
																																												patient and methodical to me<br>

																					@JMV<br> <br> Sorry for not responding
																							right away. Some things got in the way.<br>
																								<br> Well, that formula:<br> <br>
																											side A/sin(angle opposite of side A) =side
																											B/sin(angle opposite of side B) =side
																											C/sin(angle opposite of side C)<br> <br>
																													states the relationship between sides and
																													angles in triangles. It is something that
																													should have been taught right after you
																													learned about what sin, cos and tan means.
																													The above is known as the "law of sines"
																													and applies to ALL (flat plane) triangles
																													in ANY shape or size. (I'm never sure if
																													it's called "rule" or "law"; anyway there
																													is also a "law of cosines" and a "law of
																													tangents") ... Draw 3 random dots on a
																													piece of paper, draw lines between them,
																													measure the sides and angles accurately,
																													and you'll see those 3 divisions are all
																													equal. ... But you are right, if you don't
																													know how to apply it to real situations,
																													it's useless. But we'll fix that soon.<br>
																														<br> Let's start now. I suggested the
																															intercepting problem. Have a look at the
																															following drawing. (very dirty, sorry)<br>
																																http://members.home.nl/rico.v.jansen/intercept_angles2.JPG<br>
																																	<br> In it you see a moving
																																		target, and your (yo)U-boot intending
																																		to meet at some place. The target
																																		doesn't know ofcourse, but he'll play
																																		along for this explanation. The target
																																		is moving along some course with a
																																		certain speed indicated by his arrow.
																																		Far away from him, you received his
																																		location,course and speed by radio and
																																		have drawn it on the map. You see that
																																		the target is at the end of certain
																																		bearing-line (thick black line).
																																		Simply a line 'as the crow flies'. You
																																		are trying to work out which course
																																		and speed to set to meet him at the
																																		quickest possible conveniance.<br>
																																			<br> I hope you realise that
																																				setting course directly to his
																																				current position (along the drawn
																																				bearing-line) is not the way to go.
																																				By the time you have reached his
																																				position, he will be further along
																																				his course, and likely far outside
																																				of your sensor range (hydrophone).
																																				This is because of the sideways
																																				component of his speed (dark red
																																				thin arrow perpendicular to bearing
																																				line). He is going to close-in on
																																				you a bit because there is some
																																				speed component inwards, but mostly
																																				sideways. In other situations the
																																				target may be directed away or go to
																																				the right depending on his course
																																				and position. You need to match this
																																				'sideways' speed before you can
																																				invest the rest of your speed in
																																				closing the distance (along that
																																				bearing-line). That is why I have
																																				drawn (thin dark blue) arrow
																																				components next to your intended
																																				speed and course arrow. The target's
																																				red, and your blue, thin arrows
																																				(perpendicular to the bearing line)
																																				are of equal size. This keeps the
																																				target at a constant direction
																																				relative to you. He won't appear to
																																				move sideways if could magically see
																																				him with your periscope. The bearing
																																				line to him wil stay in the same
																																				direction as you both move. But now
																																				only the target is the one that is
																																				doing al the work to get closer.
																																				That's going to take a long time,
																																				and you don't want to risk he's
																																				making a course change before you
																																				get him. Since you will have excess
																																				speed compared to that sideways
																																				speed (your thick black arrow is
																																				longer) you can use it in the
																																				direction directly towards the
																																				target(and that doesn't change along
																																				the road). The other components
																																				(along the bearing line) make you
																																				close-in to one another.
																																				Unfortunately their lenghts aren't
																																				as simple as subtracting
																																				'perpendicular' from 'full speed'
																																				because the angles 'skew' the arrow
																																				lengths. (Blame Pythagoras for that)<br>
																																					<br> So, there's your problem:
																																						You have 2 speeds (you and the
																																						target) that must 'butt heads'.
																																						You know one (the target) is aimed
																																						at some angle (AOB) to the
																																						bearingline. You know his speed
																																						and know (or choose) your speed.
																																						How do you aim your speed against
																																						the bearing line? This problem can
																																						be represented with an irregularly
																																						shaped triangle where the sides
																																						are speeds! <br> <br>
																																								You said you (only) know that
																																								sin=opposite side/hypotenusa;
																																								cos=adjacent side/hypotenusa and
																																								tan=opposite side/adjacent side.
																																								That's right ... BUT those only
																																								apply to triangles that have a
																																								90 degree angle in them
																																								(right-angled triangle). Those
																																								cannot be used directly for
																																								irregularly shaped triangles
																																								with 3 'any number of
																																								degrees'-angles (like a 3-62-115
																																								degree triangle, or even
																																								60-60-60). Do you get that? This
																																								is important because nature
																																								almost never gives us problems
																																								to solve that have nice
																																								right-angled triangles. Most of
																																								the time you get irregular
																																								stuff. Also in the navigating
																																								business (as we can see with the
																																								courses in the picture above).<br>
																																									<br> But that's no
																																										problem. Because we can
																																										introduce them ourselves. We
																																										simply divide the irregular
																																										triangle in two 'right-angled'
																																										triangles, by placing a
																																										perpendicular line underneath
																																										one of the corners, and use it
																																										as an 'internal side' for
																																										intermediate calculations.
																																										(did a lightbulb flash on
																																										yet?)<br> <br> Using
																																												only that
																																												"sin=opposite/hypotenusa",
																																												we first look at the (dark
																																												red) right-angled triangle
																																												of the target:<br> <br>
																																														Hypotenusa= target_speed<br>
																																															Opposite side= unknown
																																															perpendicular_component<br>
																																																Angle= AOB<br> <br>
																																																		So:
																																																		perpendicular_component=
																																																		target_speed *
																																																		sin(AOB)<br> <br>
																																																				(Note: this is our
																																																				minumum speed! If
																																																				that is too much for
																																																				your uboot, forget
																																																				about the target!)<br>
																																																					<br> Now we
																																																						are going to match
																																																						that perpendicular
																																																						component with
																																																						your (dark blue)
																																																						speed triangle:<br>
																																																							<br> Again,
																																																								using only that
																																																								"sin=opposite/hypotenusa":<br>
																																																									<br>
																																																										Hypotenusa =
																																																										your_speed;<br>
																																																											Opposite
																																																											side= now
																																																											known
																																																											'perpendicular_component'<br>
																																																												Angle=
																																																												unkown
																																																												'intercept_angle'<br>
																																																													<br>
																																																														So:
																																																														sin(intercept_angle)
																																																														=
																																																														perpendicular_component
																																																														/
																																																														your_speed<br>
																																																															<br>
																																																																but in a
																																																																more
																																																																usefull
																																																																way:<br>
																																																																	<br>
																																																																		intercept_angle=
																																																																		arcsin(perpendicular_component
																																																																		/
																																																																		your_speed)<br>
																																																																			<br>
																																																																				Great,
																																																																				problem
																																																																				solved,
																																																																				you
																																																																				now
																																																																				know
																																																																				where
																																																																				to
																																																																				turn
																																																																				to:
																																																																				namely,
																																																																				the
																																																																				intercept_angle
																																																																				to
																																																																				the
																																																																				left
																																																																				of
																																																																				the
																																																																				bearingline.
																																																																				If
																																																																				the
																																																																				target
																																																																				is
																																																																				moving
																																																																				away
																																																																				though,
																																																																				your
																																																																				'along'-speedcomponent
																																																																				may
																																																																				not
																																																																				be
																																																																				enough
																																																																				to
																																																																				overtake
																																																																				his
																																																																				'along'-speedcomponent.
																																																																				So
																																																																				you
																																																																				need
																																																																				to
																																																																				check
																																																																				that
																																																																				too.<br>
																																																																					<br>
																																																																						Now
																																																																						let's
																																																																						put
																																																																						these
																																																																						two
																																																																						sine-equations
																																																																						into
																																																																						one
																																																																						single
																																																																						equation
																																																																						and
																																																																						see
																																																																						what
																																																																						we
																																																																						get
																																																																						(for
																																																																						curiousity
																																																																						sake):<br>
																																																																							<br>
																																																																								for
																																																																								the
																																																																								target:
																																																																								perpendicular_component=
																																																																								target_speed
																																																																								*
																																																																								sin
																																																																								(AOB)<br>
																																																																									<br>
																																																																										modify
																																																																										your's
																																																																										first;
																																																																										it
																																																																										is
																																																																										the
																																																																										same
																																																																										as:
																																																																										perpendicular_component=
																																																																										your_speed
																																																																										*
																																																																										sin
																																																																										(intercept_angle)
																																																																										<br>
																																																																											<br>
																																																																												Both
																																																																												perpendicular_components
																																																																												are
																																																																												equal
																																																																												so:<br>
																																																																													<br>
																																																																														target_speed
																																																																														*
																																																																														sin(AOB)
																																																																														=
																																																																														your_speed
																																																																														*
																																																																														sin(intercept_angle)<br>
																																																																															<br>
																																																																																Does
																																																																																that
																																																																																ring
																																																																																a
																																																																																bell?
																																																																																No?
																																																																																Maybe
																																																																																the
																																																																																following
																																																																																will,
																																																																																it's
																																																																																the
																																																																																same
																																																																																as
																																																																																above:<br>
																																																																																	<br>
																																																																																		target_speed
																																																																																		/
																																																																																		sin(intercept_angle)
																																																																																		=
																																																																																		your_speed
																																																																																		/
																																																																																		sin
																																																																																		(AOB)<br>
																																																																																			<br>
																																																																																				We
																																																																																				just
																																																																																				proved
																																																																																				the
																																																																																				'Law
																																																																																				of
																																																																																				Sines'
																																																																																				!!!!<br>
																																																																																					<br>
																																																																																						Then
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						might
																																																																																						ask,
																																																																																						where
																																																																																						's
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						3rd
																																																																																						part?
																																																																																						Well
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						only
																																																																																						need
																																																																																						2
																																																																																						sides
																																																																																						for
																																																																																						an
																																																																																						equation
																																																																																						symbol
																																																																																						(=)
																																																																																						to
																																																																																						work.
																																																																																						We
																																																																																						haven't
																																																																																						had
																																																																																						a
																																																																																						need
																																																																																						for
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						3rd
																																																																																						sofar.
																																																																																						But
																																																																																						if
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						look
																																																																																						at
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						drawing
																																																																																						again,
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						see
																																																																																						those
																																																																																						components
																																																																																						along
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						bearing
																																																																																						line.
																																																																																						That's
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						3rd
																																																																																						side.
																																																																																						Added
																																																																																						up
																																																																																						together
																																																																																						they
																																																																																						show
																																																																																						how
																																																																																						fast
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						close
																																																																																						to
																																																																																						one
																																																																																						another.
																																																																																						If
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						know
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						3rd
																																																																																						angle
																																																																																						(and
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						do!,
																																																																																						because
																																																																																						there
																																																																																						are
																																																																																						only
																																																																																						180
																																																																																						degrees
																																																																																						in
																																																																																						any
																																																																																						triangle,
																																																																																						and
																																																																																						2
																																																																																						of
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						3
																																																																																						angles
																																																																																						are
																																																																																						now
																																																																																						known,
																																																																																						so
																																																																																						3rd
																																																																																						angle=
																																																																																						180-
																																																																																						AOB
																																																																																						-
																																																																																						intercept_angle)
																																																																																						you
																																																																																						can
																																																																																						use
																																																																																						either
																																																																																						one
																																																																																						of
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						first
																																																																																						2
																																																																																						'Law
																																																																																						of
																																																																																						Sines'-parts
																																																																																						to
																																																																																						calculate
																																																																																						the
																																																																																						closing
																																																																																						speed,
																																																																																						as:<br>
																																																																																							<br>
																																																																																								target_speed/
																																																																																								sin(intercept_angle)
																																																																																								=
																																																																																								closing_speed/
																																																																																								sin(180
																																																																																								-
																																																																																								AOB
																																																																																								-
																																																																																								intercept_angle)<br>
																																																																																									<br>
																																																																																										or<br>
																																																																																											<br>
																																																																																												your_speed
																																																																																												/
																																																																																												sin
																																																																																												(AOB)
																																																																																												=
																																																																																												closing_speed/
																																																																																												sin(180
																																																																																												-
																																																																																												AOB
																																																																																												-intercept_angle)<br>
																																																																																													<br>
																																																																																														But:
																																																																																														sin(A)=sin(180
																																																																																														-
																																																																																														A)
																																																																																														because
																																																																																														of
																																																																																														symmetry
																																																																																														reasons,
																																																																																														so
																																																																																														you
																																																																																														can
																																																																																														just
																																																																																														use
																																																																																														sin(AOB+Intercept_angle)
																																																																																														instead
																																																																																														in
																																																																																														those
																																																																																														formula's.<br>
																																																																																															<br>
																																																																																																I'll
																																																																																																straigthen
																																																																																																those
																																																																																																two
																																																																																																out
																																																																																																so
																																																																																																you
																																																																																																can
																																																																																																see
																																																																																																how
																																																																																																to
																																																																																																calculate
																																																																																																closing_speed:<br>
																																																																																																	<br>
																																																																																																		closing_speed
																																																																																																		=
																																																																																																		target_speed
																																																																																																		*
																																																																																																		sin(AOB
																																																																																																		+
																																																																																																		intercept_angle)
																																																																																																		/
																																																																																																		sin(intercept_angle)<br>
																																																																																																			<br>
																																																																																																				and
																																																																																																				<br>
																																																																																																					<br>
																																																																																																						closing_speed
																																																																																																						=
																																																																																																						your_speed
																																																																																																						*
																																																																																																						sin(
																																																																																																						AOB
																																																																																																						+
																																																																																																						intercept_angle)
																																																																																																						/
																																																																																																						sin
																																																																																																						(AOB)<br>
																																																																																																							<br>
																																																																																																								Now
																																																																																																								the
																																																																																																								time_to_meetingpoint
																																																																																																								in
																																																																																																								hours
																																																																																																								is
																																																																																																								simply
																																																																																																								the
																																																																																																								length
																																																																																																								of
																																																																																																								the
																																																																																																								bearing
																																																																																																								line
																																																																																																								(initial
																																																																																																								distance
																																																																																																								converted
																																																																																																								to
																																																																																																								nautical
																																																																																																								miles)
																																																																																																								divided
																																																																																																								by
																																																																																																								this
																																																																																																								speed.
																																																																																																								(in
																																																																																																								knots
																																																																																																								naturally)<br>
																																																																																																									<br>
																																																																																																										That's
																																																																																																										the
																																																																																																										end
																																																																																																										of
																																																																																																										math
																																																																																																										class
																																																																																																										for
																																																																																																										now.
																																																																																																										For
																																																																																																										next
																																																																																																										weeks
																																																																																																										assignment
																																																																																																										I
																																																																																																										want
																																																																																																										you
																																																																																																										to
																																																																																																										solve
																																																																																																										'Fermat's
																																																																																																										last
																																																																																																										theorem'.
																																																																																																										;)<br>
																																																																																																											<br>
																																																																																																												No,
																																																																																																												kidding
																																																																																																												asside,
																																																																																																												I
																																																																																																												tried
																																																																																																												to
																																																																																																												make
																																																																																																												every
																																																																																																												step
																																																																																																												in
																																																																																																												the
																																																																																																												thought
