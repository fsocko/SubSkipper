This is an optional mod that includes a scale for 75m targets. 

Historically this scale did not exist in the U-jagd stoppuhr,
but some may prefer it as 75m approximates to the length of most
smaller merchants as well as destroyers.

Note the scale only goes up to 10 knots.

If you wish to apply this mod, it is a very simple thing to do.

In the U-jagd tools mod file, go to the menu_1024_768

This is in

SH3/MODS/U-jagd tools1.3/data/menu

At the top of this file, go to <Edit> and the <Find>

Type in to the search field

U-jagd_chrono.tga

When you get to it, change it to

U-jagd_chrono75m.tga

That's it!

Gute Jagd
