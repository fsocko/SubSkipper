8: THIS IS HOW I DO IT NOW: Use a handheld stopwatch, and the length table below (or your paper version of the recognition manual, if you have it).I set the crosshair of my TBT or Periscope ahead of the boat and start the stopwatch exactly when the bow passes through my sights. You must NOT use target lock ("L" key), and your sub must be stationary or near stationary. I stop the watch exactly when the stern passes through. Next, I take the length of the ship (listed in the recog.manual) and divide by the number of seconds it took to pass through my sights. This gives me the target speed in meters/second, which can easily be multiplied by 2 to find speed in knots (actually 1.94, but 2 is close enough). Example: The Yamato (263 meters long) passes through my sights in 30 seconds. 263meters/30seconds = 8.8 m/s. Multiplied with 2 we get 17.6 knots... Good enough for Navy use. This technique works at almost any AOB and any distance as the time to run one boatlength is the only thing measured and is the same no matter where you see it from. But remember to stop your sub for this.

Recog Manual Ship Length
See the black & white scale line under the Yamato picture? You can find this under each and every ship in the ingame recongnition manual.

Every black or white segment is about 33 meters (or about 90 foot)
I can count 6 steps in the scale line under the Yamato Battleship and about 2 more steps I can add to get the full ship lengt.
33 * 8 = 264 meters

TMO 2.5
Additional Controls

Tab or the mouse wheel brings up the binocular view.
B – calls battle stations
Q – opens tube doors
W – cycles forward tubes
E – cycles aft tubes (emergency surface is located only on the orders bar now)
D – dives the sub to its safety depth.

The exception to using 'D' is the Balao and Tench class boats. By pressing the D key they will not stop their decent until it crushes from pressure, or until you issue the command to maintain current depth.

T – Raise/lower SD radar antenna

Mk14 Torp Problems:
- The magnetic exploder would premature or not explode at all
– The impact firing pin would bend on impact, thereby resulting in a dud.
– Erratic depth control, often running 10 to 12 feet deeper then set.

Periscope:

In low power each small division represents one degree while in high power each all division represents 1/4 degree. If the Approach

Range

R(range) = (19.1 h / n)
R(range) = (76.2 h / N)

R = range in yards
h = height in feet
n number scale divisions low power
N number scale divisions hi power

Estimating Length:

L (length) = R n / 19.1 SinAb
L (length) = R N / 76.2 SinAb

R = Range in yards
n = Number scale divisions in low power
N = Number scale divisions hi power
Ab = Angle on the bow

(d) A simple variation of the telemeter principle is to determine the target length in degrees from the telemeter scale (one large division equals 1 degree in high power; one small division equals 1 degree in low power). Since 1 degree subtends 17.5 yards or 52.5 feet at 1000 yards, we may round this off and say that 1 degree subtends 50 feet at 1000 yards. Therefore, the following formula can be used with acceptable accuracy:

Target Length No. degrees subtended X 50 ft X 
(Range in 1000's yards) / (Sin Ab)




603. COMPUTED SPREAD:

(a) The computed spread is based on the fact that 1 degree subtends approximately 100 feet at 2000 yards. From this the formula may be deduced:

No. Degrees Total Spread= (Tar. Length in Feet/100) X (% Coverage) X (2000/Torpedo Run) X (SIN TTa)

(b) The main advantage of this spread is that the Approach Officer may designate exactly the coverage be desires for any given situation. Also no "gadget" is required.

(c) The following table should be used for the sine of the torpedo track angle.

Torpedo Track	Sine
15-30	1/4
30-45	1/2
45-60	3/4
60-90	1

(d) The following table should be used for torpedo run.

Torpedo Run Actual	Torpedo Run Used
700 - 1250	1000
1250 - 1750	1500
1750 - 2250	2000
2250 - 2750	2500
2750 - 3250	3000

SPEED
3) If the target and the submarine have not changed course, the target has not changed speed, and the true bearing has remained constant over a period of 2 to 3 minutes, the target speed may be determined by the formula under plate XVI.


(f) Distance to Track
The distance to the track is equal to the sine of the angle on the bow times the range. This may be approximated by the formula:

Distance to Track = (Ab / 60) X Range



BLANK 840. DEFLECTION ANGLE FOR STRAIGHT FIRE:

The deflection angle for a straight shot of any torpedo run for target speeds less than one-half the torpedo speed, may be approximated as follows:

Torpedo
Track Angle	 	46 Knot Torpedo	 	29 Knot Torpedo
1. 90 degrees	 	1 1/4 x Target Speed	 	2 x Target Speed
2. 60 degrees	 	75% of (1)	 	75% of (1)
3. 40 degrees	 	50% or (1)	 	50% of (1)
4. 18 degrees	 	25% of (1)	 	25% of (1)
5. Optimum	 	1-1/3 x Target Speed


3min:15sec observation to find speed in knots

7 1/2 minutes is twice the familiar 3:15 minutes interval: the distance travelled (in m) is 200 times the speed in knots. In a typical situation the target might approach with 10 - 12 knots,  the critical distance is then 2000 - 2400 m.


Lead angle for John P Cromwell and Dick O'Kane

Lead angle = Atan(torpedo speed, target speed)

Speed:
(yds / 3min)/100 = knots
(metre / 3:15min)/100 = knots
